# BLE Peripherals

:exclamation:**Warning**:exclamation: I'm not an EE by any means and I have no
idea what I'm doing! These designs are for reference only and should not be
used.

If you are an EE or am knowledgeable enough to fix my mistakes, a pull
request would be most welcome.

Now that that's out of the way, this repository includes the hardware for
various BLE-based sensors and actuators. Each directory includes a schematic,
PCB layout and a plastic enclosure design for a BLE peripheral.

The software for these designs can be found in my
[cc2640-home-automation](https://github.com/shmuelzon/cc2640-home-automation)
repository.
